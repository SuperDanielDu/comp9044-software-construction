==History==
===1988–1991: The Hot 100===
The idea for the poll came from Triple J producer Lawrie Zion in late 1988.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/audio/hot100_1989.mp3 How Hottest 100 started (mp3)]</ref> During this time, he conceived the idea of running a listener poll to determine their 100 favourite songs of all time.<ref name="ABCJ"/> The idea was allegedly stolen from [[Brisbane]] community radio station [[4zzz]], which developed the original Hot 100 in 1976.{{cn|date=January 2019}}

For the Hot 100, before Triple J had become a national broadcaster, Sydney listeners were required to write their 10 favourite tracks on the back of an envelope.<ref name="ABCJ"/> Some entries were sent into the station written on a variety of items, including paintings, sculptures, and hand-rolled cannabis cigarettes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The results of the first poll were counted down on Sunday 5 March 1989 between 10am and 6pm.

The station repeated the event the following year when it started broadcasting to other capital cities besides Sydney. In 1991, Triple J was forced to change the poll's name to 'Hottest 100' to avoid legal action with 4zzz.

During the poll's first few years — from 1989 to 1991 — the winner in the first two years was "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]" by [[Joy Division]],<ref name="ABCJ"/> while 1991's favourite song was "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],<ref name="ABCJ"/> which had been released that year.

===1992–1995: The Hottest 100===
Realising that the poll's results were unlikely to significantly change from year to year, Triple J rested the Hottest 100 in 1992 and relaunched it as an annual poll the following year. The newly launched poll required listeners to vote for their favourite songs of that year. Denis Leary's comedy anthem "Asshole" was voted number 1 in .<ref name="ABCJ"/>

The inaugural Hottest 100 compilation CD, ''Triple J Hottest 100 (The Hottest Of The Hottest)'', was released by [[ABC Music]] in 1994. [[Denis Leary]]'s "Asshole" was voted in the number-one position in that year, while the radio-edited version of [[Ween]]'s "Push the Little Daisies",<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/history/1993.htm</ref> featuring a sample of musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] howling in place of the word "shit", appeared on the CD.<ref>{{cite web|title=Various – Triple J Hottest 100 (The Hottest Of The Hottest) - 1|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Triple-J-Hottest-100-The-Hottest-Of-The-Hottest-1/release/396987|website=Various on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref>

===1996–2016: Rise in Australian music ===
In 1996, [[Spiderbait]] became the first Australian act to reach number 1. Since 1999, Australian acts have made up the majority of the polls.<ref name="abc.net.au">{{cite web |title=History {{!}} Hottest 100 Archive {{!}} triple j |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/archive/history/ |website=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=en-AU |date=11 November 2017}}</ref>

The first Hottest 100 DVD, ''Triple J Hottest 100: The Hottest Videos For 2002'', was released in 2002. [[Queens Of The Stone Age]]'s "No One Knows" was voted into the top position in that year, while [[Grinspoon]], [[Motor Ace]], [[Darren Hanlon]], Machine Translations and [[Ms Dynamite]] were other Hottest 100 artists featured on the release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Various – Triple J Hottest 100 - The Hottest Videos For 2002|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Triple-J-Hottest-100-The-Hottest-Videos-For-2002/release/3235437|website=Various on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref>

In 2003, [[Powderfinger]] became the first act to be featured three times in the top 10 poll with "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind", "Sunsets" and "Love Your Way" placing in the 4th, 7th and 10th places, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=hottest 100 2003|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/2003.htm|website=triple j Hottest 100|publisher=ABC|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref> All three songs appeared on the 2003 ''[[Vulture Street (album)|Vulture Street]]'' full-length studio album, which attained "6 x Platinum" sales in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Record Sales - 2003 Full Year Figures - 12 Months Ending 31 December 2003|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/australianrecordsales-2003fullyearfigures.htm|website=ARIA Australian Recording Industry Association|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association Ltd.|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=2005–2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Powderfinger – Vulture Street|url=http://www.discogs.com/Powderfinger-Vulture-Street/master/251585|website=Powderfinger on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref> Powderfinger is also the only Australian artist to reach number 1 twice.<ref name="abc.net.au"/>

After its beginnings as a write-in poll, the Hottest 100 progressed to phone-in voting, which then progressed to SMS and online voting. In 2003, only web votes through the Triple J website were accepted, with registration required and a limit of 10 votes applied. In 2004, the guidelines were expanded so that voters were entitled to 10 internet votes and 10 SMS votes.

In 2014, [[Chet Faker]], whose real name is Nick Murphy, repeated Powderfinger's achievement from 2003 by placing three times in the top 10 positions. Faker reached the number-one spot with "[[Talk Is Cheap (Chet Faker song)|Talk Is Cheap]]" and the 7th and 8th positions, respectively, with "Gold" and "[[1998 (Chet Faker song)|1998]]". All three songs came from Faker's 2014 album ''[[Built On Glass]]''. Chet Faker placed a total of four times in the entire poll, with a [[cover version]] of [[Sonia Dada]]'s "Lover You Don't Treat Me No Good No More" in the 22nd position. The 22nd Hottest 100 poll received a record 2,099,707 million votes, cast by 258,762 voters from 188 countries.<ref name="Chet">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/chet-fakers-talk-is-cheap-wins-triple-j-hottest-100-20150126-12ykg4.html|title=Chet Faker's Talk Is Cheap wins Triple J Hottest 100|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=26 January 2015|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Triple J]] announced that they would be holding 2018's Hottest 100 on January 27, instead of the traditional date of January 26.

==Notable artists==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2018}}
In the 25 years since its inception, the bands who have been featured the most are [[Powderfinger]], with 22 songs between the 1996 and 2009 countdowns, and the [[Foo Fighters]], who charted 22 times between 1995 and 2014. In 2011, it was incorrectly stated that Foo Fighters had the most appearances.<ref>http://hottest100.org/fingervsfoo.html</ref>
Powderfinger's frontman, [[Bernard Fanning]], has taken the top spot on three occasions, twice with [[Powderfinger]] in 1999 and 2000 and once as a solo artist in 2005.

[[Dave Grohl]] has appeared 32 times throughout the countdown's history, including the top spot on two occasions (1991, 2002); 13 of those appearances were from the Hottest 100 Of All Time countdowns. He has appeared 4 times with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], 22 with [[Foo Fighters]], 6 with [[Queens of The Stone Age]] and once with [[Them Crooked Vultures]]. In fact, Grohl has appeared in the most countdowns run by Triple J, only excluding those in 1989, 1990, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012.

[[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]] has appeared 34 times throughout the countdown's lifetime; 28 of those instances were in the All Time countdowns. Five additional entries came from countdowns between 1993 and 1997 with a final appearance, to date, through a collaboration with [[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]] in 2010.

==Controversy==

===Lack of female artist representation===
There has been increased debate regarding lack of representation of female artists in the Hottest 100 each year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Triple J's Hottest 100: where are the female singers? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/09/triple-j-100-women|work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 January 2018|date=9 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Karen Pickering |title=Feminism and Music |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122055321/http://mskarenpickering.com.au:80/2013/06/09/feminism-and-music/ |website=The Wayback Machine|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=9 June 2013}}</ref> In 2017 only sixteen of the artists were female,<ref>{{cite web|title=PLAYLIST: Australian women on triple j's 2017 Hottest 100 |url=http://www.musiclove.com.au/blog/2017/1/27/playlist-australian-women-on-triple-js-2017-hottest-100|website=musiclove|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=27 January 2017}}</ref> compared to 2015 where despite 48% of voters being female, only thirteen female solo artists and eight female fronted or duo artists received votes.<ref>{{cite news|author= |title=Triple J Hottest 100: It's a man's world|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/triple-j-hottest-100-its-a-mans-world-20150127-12yx4x.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=27 January 2015}}</ref> A  break down was provided by Casey Briggs for the 2014 Hottest 100<ref>{{cite web|author=Casey Briggs|title=The 2014 Hottest 100, by the numbers|url=http://www.caseybriggs.com/blog/2015/1/26/the-2014-hottest-100-by-the-numbers|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=26 January 2015}}</ref> and previous Hottest 100 polls over the Last 20 years (2013).<ref>{{cite web|author=Casey Briggs |title=Women in the Hottest 100: Some numbers |url=http://caseybriggs.tumblr.com/post/52540078370/women-in-the-hottest-100-some-numbers|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=6 September 2013}}</ref>

===#Tay4Hottest100===
Following a 13 January 2015 article on [[BuzzFeed]], the "#Tay4Hottest100" [[hashtag]] campaign began during the voting period for the Hottest 100 poll for 2014. According to those critical of the campaign, the Hottest 100 is reserved for non-mainstream artists who were "discovered or fostered by Triple J" and provides valuable exposure for artists in the outer circles of the music industry.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Peter Vincent|title=Triple J Hottest 100: Has Taylor Swift been dumped from contention due to KFC ad?|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/triple-j-hottest-100-has-taylor-swift-been-dumped-from-contention-due-to-kfc-ad-20150120-12u1gi.html|accessdate=23 January 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Sarah Smith|title=Flight Facilities weigh in on Taylor Swift Hottest 100 furore|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/59825/Flight_Facilities_weigh_in_on_Taylor_Swift_Hottest_100_furore|website=inthemix|publisher=inthemix Pty Ltd|accessdate=23 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}</ref>

The campaign led to discussion <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/search?search=taylor%20swift%20hottest%20100&any=on|title=NEWS {{!}} radioinfo|website=www.radioinfo.com.au|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> about the broader cultural implications of the controversy generated by Swift. The ''[[Guardian Australia|Guardian]]''{{'}}s Elle Hunt wrote: "... the virulent response to #Tay4Hottest100 has revealed the persistence of a dichotomy I'd thought we'd thrown out long ago: that of high art versus low."<ref>{{cite news|author1=Elle Hunt|title=#Tay4Hottest100: Taylor Swift campaign shows it's time for Triple J to shake off cultural elitism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/19/tay4hottest100-taylor-swift-campaign-shows-its-time-for-triple-j-to-shake-off-cultural-elitism|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=19 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Mark Di Stefano|title=Why Isn't Everyone Voting For "Shake It Off" In The Hottest 100?|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/tay-4-hottest100#.gmLzd8y1p|website=BuzzFeed|publisher=BuzzFeed, Inc|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=13 January 2015}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'' on 23 January 2015, [[Charles Darwin University]] academic Gemma Blackwood concluded:

<blockquote>
The cultural and economic meanings attached to the celebrity-sign of "Taylor Swift" seems antithetical to Triple J's self-representation as a place for exciting new music, with a supposed focus on emerging Australian talent. This perhaps explains why Swift is excluded from the playlist when other "mainstream" American artists and chart toppers ... are still played on the station heavily: the alignment and transfer of values of what is considered "cool" and "hip" between the station and its chosen artists ... The concept of "youth" seems to be used in reference to a musical market and to identify particular music genres rather than being a real or an accurate signifier of young tastes and interests. It raises the question: what responsibility does a national youth broadcaster have in the shaping and the adapting of young musical interests?<ref name="Gem">{{cite news|author1=Gemma Blackwood|title=Taylor Swift, Triple J and what the youth market really wants to hear|url=http://theconversation.com/taylor-swift-triple-j-and-what-the-youth-market-really-wants-to-hear-36643|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=The Conversation|date=23 January 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

Station manager Chris Scaddan told the media that the Swift campaign was within the rules of the poll, later instructing Triple J employees not to comment to "media, friends, family" about the campaign, as "it will all become clear when we get to the countdown next Monday." The station said: "we don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open. It draws attention to them and may influence the results of the poll."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Joe Harris|title=The Guardian Says Triple J Are "Sexist" For Ignoring Taylor Swift, & That's Just Dumb|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/432757/guardian-triple-j-sexist-taylor-swift.htm|website=Tone Deaf|publisher=Tone Deaf|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}</ref> Marketing website Mumbrella suggested on 20 January that a Facebook post by [[KFC]] incorporating the "#Tay4Hottest100" hashtag was against the Hottest 100 rules and could see Swift disqualified.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Christensen|first1=Nic|title=KFC Facebook post may have disqualified Taylor Swift campaign from Triple J Hottest 100 list|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/abc-coy-taylor-swifts-hottest-100-eligibility-kfc-tries-jump-tay4hottest100-bandwagon-271943|website=Mumbrella|accessdate=22 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}</ref> The ''Guardian'' submitted a freedom of information request to the ABC in regard to the station's response to the campaign.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Elle Hunt|title=Taylor Swift fans have spoken – but will Triple J's Hottest 100 listen?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/20/taylor-swift-fans-have-spoken-but-will-triple-js-hottest-100-listen|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=20 January 2015}}</ref>

After journalist Peter Vincent reported that the Swift campaign had "swallowed" the Hottest 100 for 2014, citing research from the [[University of Queensland]] that showed that over 7,341 Hottest 100 posts in a 30-day period leading up to the poll results related to Swift, "Shake It Off" was eventually disqualified by the radio station in an announcement on 26 January 2015. The official announcement read: "it became pretty clear, pretty quick that a lot of people just wanted to prod some 'hipsters' for the lulz", acknowledging that the station "had a heap of fun", while Swift is "smart", "cool" and "successful". The song would have placed in the number-12 position if it had been allowed to compete.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Cameron Adams|title=Taylor Swift disqualified from Hottest 100|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/taylor-swift-disqualified-from-hottest-100/story-fnndfy6b-1227196860796|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=News.com.au|date=26 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Peter Vincent|title=Taylor Swift campaign has swallowed Triple J Hottest 100|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/taylor-swift-campaign-has-swallowed-triple-j-hottest-100-20150123-12wfs1.html|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 January 2015}}</ref>

On the inside cover of the Triple J Hottest 100 Volume 22 CD, bold capital initials spell out "TAYLOR SWIFT BAN".

===Moving the Date===
In mid-2016, support grew for a campaign calling on Triple J to change the date of the Hottest 100. Calls were led by [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] activists and supporters, many of whom regard Australia Day as "Invasion Day". [[Australian hip hop]] duo [[A.B. Original]] and their anti-Australia Day single "January 26" were instrumental in drawing support to the cause. Triple J responded to the campaign in September 2016, announcing a review over whether the date of the Hottest 100 should be changed.

The review of the date continued into 2017, including consultation with [[Reconciliation Australia]], the [[National Congress of Australia's First Peoples]], and the [[National Australia Day Council]], while [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2016|2016's Hottest 100]] was held on Australia Day without change. In August 2017, Triple J launched a survey asking for public opinion on whether the date should be changed. Shortly after the survey began, former Triple J presenters [[Matt Okine]] and Kyran Wheatley came out in support of a date change.

On 27 November 2017, Triple J announced plans to move the Hottest 100 to the fourth weekend of January. This followed analysis led by [[Rebecca Huntley]] of the aforementioned survey, which attracted 64,990 responses, indicating that 60% of listeners supported moving the date. The announcement was welcomed by many musicians and the [[Australian Greens]]. Within the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], however, Communications Minister [[Mitch Fifield]] was reportedly "bewildered" by the choice, one that MP [[Alex Hawke]] described as "disappointing" and "pathetic". As the minister responsible for the government-funded [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), which Triple J is part of, Fifield wrote to the ABC's [[board of directors]] on 28 November asking them to return the Hottest 100 to Australia Day.

Some organisations offered alternatives to Triple J's Hottest 100 in response to the date change. These include nationwide rock radio station [[Triple M]] broadcasting an ''Ozzest 100'' countdown of only [[Music of Australia|Australian songs]] on 26 January, and Senator [[Cory Bernardi]]'s [[Australian Conservatives]] publishing an ''AC100'' playlist of Australian music on [[Spotify]].
